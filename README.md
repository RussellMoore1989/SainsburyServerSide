# SainsburyServerSide

There is an exacutable jar file ready to be ran with the dependencies.
IDE used : Eclipse
Exported in : Eclipse

Further work:

- Just to make the app a little less restricting is that you could also have a String argument passed for the main.

- Add a file reader and console log out the resulting file.

- Beautify the JSON output in the test file and the console output.

- Maybe a string argument for the resulting filename of the json.
